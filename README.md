## Description: 

This is a responsive React single-page application that I desgined to display my top projects from my portfolio. The theme is inspired by the [Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator) franchise and is illustrated with custom pixel art I created using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OfeNDukXm8).
