			<h1>01. About me.</h1>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Pasha, and I am a first generation Russian American graphic artist and web developer
				who is clearly not obsessed with sci-fi. My interest in software engineering was sparked in 2022 when I
				started Springboard's coding bootcamp. Turns out that building websites was my ideal bubble for artistic
				expression. I'm currently based in Pacific Grove, CA, and searching for full-stack or frontend roles. I
				hope to find myself in a fast-paced, ambitious, and healthy postive work environment. Here are a few of
				the technologies I've been working with recently:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Node</li>
				<li>Express</li>
				<li>Tailwind CSS</li>
				<li>Framer Motion</li>
				<li>Postgresql</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
